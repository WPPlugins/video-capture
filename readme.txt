= Using Vidrack =

Install Vidrack Video Recorder as you would any other plugin.

Just add one of the following shortcodes to a page or post:
`[vidrack align="left"]`
`[vidrack align="right"]`
`[vidrack align="center"]`
or just
`[vidrack]`

All your fans have to do is click on the "video record" button and the video recorder will open
their webcam or mobile camera.

Its important to put clear instructions to your website visitors on what kind of video you want
them to record. If your page doesn't specify what you want from people then no one will record
video.

== 3rd Party Integration ==

Use `ext_id` parameter, which is passed all the way to the DB:
`[vidrack ext_id="123"]`

Use `JavaScript Callback Function` option to send custom callbacks. For example,
if you enter `test_func`, then plugin calls `test_func(filename, ip, ext_id)` upon
successful video upload.

= Downloading Videos =

Downloading videos is quick and easy.

Simply login into your admin area of your WordPress site. Click on the tab in the left hand menu,
called 'Vidrack'. This is where you will access your videos. On this page you see a list of all the
videos that have been submitted to you. Depending on your browser you can either click on the link
to download the video or right click on the link to download it. Once you have downloaded the video
you can delete the video, off the server, by clicking the box next to the link and clicking the
delete button on the bottom.

== Installation ==

Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use Vidrack? =

Crowdsourced Video is some of the most powerful and engaging content. Vidrack increases website
engagement and/or video interviewing/reporting efficiency within any organization. Video
testimonials, video reviews, video opinions, video feedback, video contests, video interviews and
fan videos are all great content for your website. The problem is its hard to collect unless you
use a web-based video recorder. And we believe Vidrack is the easiest and most economical of any
browser-based video recorder.

= Does Vidrack Video Recorder work on all WordPress Sites? =

Yes it works on all WordPress sites that meet WordPress best practices. Sometimes Vidrack has
trouble when a site is improperly configured.

= Does Vidrack work on all devices? =

Vidrack works on all devices that are newer that 2 years old using a good Internet or mobile
connections. For desktop devices Adobe Flash must be installed.

= Why does Vidrack use Adobe Flash? =

Due to the nature of desktop browser recording we must use flash for desktop recordings. Mobile
submissions are done using HTML5. As time goes on, we hope to eventually remove the need for Flash.

= Does Vidrack work on all browsers? =

Vidrack works on Chrome, Firefox, Edge and other mainstream browsers that follow common browser
standards. For lesser known browsers we sometimes experience issues beyond our control. If your
browser isn't following web standards then it won't work.

= Why is Vidrack free? =

We think web-based video recording should be free. Just like water, food and communication should
be free. But we do have bills to pay. Soon we will be asking larger organizations to pay for their
video campaigns. We're also working hard to release a premium paid video recorder with value added
features

= Where are the videos stored? =

Vidrack has a secure Amazon server where videos are stored. This prevents strain on your website
hosting resources. Most WordPress hosting services aren't built for storing videos.

= What should I do if the plugin doesn't work with my theme or conflicts with other plugins? =

The reality of WordPress plugins is sometimes they have plugin conflicts or theme conflicts.

The only two solutions to this are change themes, find the offending plugin by deactivating each
one individually or you can try our web-application available at http://vidrack.me and embed our
recorder on your WordPress site. For more info on embedding see http://vidrack.com/embed. Note that
if your use our web app you must access your videos at http://vidrack.me

= What if I want to use Vidrack but don't want it on my website? =

You can make a Video Recorder Landing Page with our web application. It will give you a branded
Vidrack URL you can submit videos through. For more info see http://vidrack.com/pages

= What are the limitations of web-based video recording? =

Users submitting video with mobile devices that are over 2 years old, have poor Internet
connections and/or uncommon browsers may experience video submission issues. The best solution is
try a different device, different Internet connection and different browser. Read
